   want to serve static files run 'cargo build --release --no-default-features'

## Init scripts

In the init-scripts directory there's OpenRC(Courtesy of Tastytea) and systemd
service files.

## CGI and SCGI

There's example SCGI scripts for python and perl in the cgi-scripts directory.

In the configuration file there's "cgi" which is an optional bool to turn cgi
on. If it's true it'll run scripts from any directory. To limit it to only one
directory set "cgipath"

If "cgi" is false or not set the server will respond "Not Found" to any
executable file.

Scripts have 5 seconds to complete or they will be terminated.

### CGI Environments

These variables are preset for you. If you need more you can define them in the
config file under "cgienv"

 - GEMINI_URL
 - SERVER_NAME
 - SERVER_PROTOCOL
 - SERVER_SOFTWARE
 - SCRIPT_NAME
 - REMOTE_ADDR
 - REMOTE_HOST
 - REMOTE_PORT
 - QUERY_STRING
 - PATH_INFO

TLS variables
 - AUTH_TYPE
 - TLS_CLIENT_HASH
 - REMOTE_USER

### Auth Location

This features adds an access control to a directory path.
You can create multiple secured location.
It checks the TLS_CLIENT_HASH of the client certificat to hashkeys saved in a plain text file.
Check out the config.toml for configuration example.
Also there is an example how user can subscribe to the auth location in the cgi-scripts directory. 
Examples is called subscribe.sh

In your toml file you can set this up as :
[[server.authlocation]]
root = "/path/to/serv/private"
path = "/private"
index = "index.gmi"
# you can place the keys anywhere you want. best not to place them inside your capsule
auth_basic = "/path/to/private/.hashkeys"
